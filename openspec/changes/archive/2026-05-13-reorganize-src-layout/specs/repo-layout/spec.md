## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Source tree under `src/` groups files by UI role

`src/` SHALL group TypeScript files by the role they play, not by
filename pattern. The role-based subdirectories are:

- `src/screens/` — top-level screen components (one per HTML page) and
  the base class they extend. Currently: `screen.ts` (base),
  `home-screen.ts`, `puzzle-screen.ts`. Future per-screen Lit
  components belong here.
- `src/dialogs/` — modal / popover Lit components shown as overlays from
  one or more screens. Currently: `about-dialog.ts`, `alert-dialog.ts`,
  `crash-dialog.ts`, `enter-gameid-dialog.ts`,
  `saved-game-dialogs.ts`, `settings-dialog.ts`, `share-dialog.ts`.
- `src/components/` — reusable leaf Lit components that don't fit
  screen-or-dialog. Currently: `catalog-card.ts`, `command-link.ts`,
  `dynamic-content.ts`, `head-matter.ts`, `help-viewer.ts`,
  `saved-game-list.ts`.

The following kinds of files SHALL stay at `src/` root, not under a
subdirectory, because they are entry points or cross-cutting:

- HTML page entries referenced by `templates/*.html.hbs` (currently
  `home-page.ts`, `puzzle-page.ts`).
- The main bootstrap (`main.ts`), the old-browser preflight gate
  (`preflight.ts`), and the service worker (`sw.ts`).
- Cross-cutting modules with no single-screen owner: `routing.ts`,
  `color-scheme.ts`, `color-scheme-init.ts`, `icons.ts`.
- Ambient-type files such as `vite-env.d.ts`.

Existing subdirectories with non-UI scope SHALL keep their shape:
`src/assets/` (generated), `src/css/` (styles), `src/native/` (TS
puzzle-engine ports), `src/puzzle/` (puzzle runtime + Comlink worker),
`src/store/` (Dexie schema), `src/utils/` (general-purpose helpers).

#### Scenario: A new Lit component lands in the right bucket

- **WHEN** a contributor adds a new top-level screen, dialog, or leaf
  component
- **THEN** the file is placed under `src/screens/`, `src/dialogs/`, or
  `src/components/` respectively
- **AND** the file is NOT added loose at `src/` root

#### Scenario: Page-entry script URLs in HTML templates still resolve

- **WHEN** the change has landed
- **THEN** `templates/index.html.hbs` continues to load
  `/src/home-page.ts` and `templates/puzzle.html.hbs` continues to load
  `/src/puzzle-page.ts`
- **AND** neither file moves, because both are HTML page entries

#### Scenario: Renames preserve git history

- **WHEN** files are relocated from `src/` root into a subdirectory
- **THEN** `git mv` is used (not delete + add) so
  `git log --follow <new path>` walks back into pre-move history
