## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The midend repaints on every transition and drives animation

The TS midend SHALL cause the canvas to repaint after every state
transition it processes — moves, undo, redo, solve, restart, load,
and UI-only updates — mirroring the C frontend, which redraws after
every processed input. A transition that changes what is displayed
SHALL NOT leave the canvas stale.

For games that animate, the midend SHALL drive the animation/flash
timer to parity with `midend.c`: it SHALL obtain the animation and
flash durations from the game, run the timer while either an
animation/flash is in progress or a timed-clock game is running, paint
each animation frame, and settle to a final clean paint when the
animation completes. A non-animated transition SHALL paint once;
animation frames (including the first) SHALL be driven by the timer
rather than by an extra synchronous paint that would race the timer.

#### Scenario: A processed move repaints

- **WHEN** the midend processes a move, undo, redo, solve, restart,
  load, or UI-only update
- **THEN** a repaint of the canvas is requested for that transition
- **AND** the displayed board reflects the new state without requiring
  any further external redraw call

#### Scenario: An animated move is driven by the timer to completion

- **WHEN** a move on an animating game is processed
- **THEN** the midend arms the animation/flash timer and the canvas is
  repainted on each timer tick through the animation
- **AND** when the animation and flash complete the midend settles
  with a final paint of the resting state and releases the timer

#### Scenario: A non-rendering port is not at parity

- **WHEN** a TS port processes input correctly but the midend does not
  repaint (the game appears frozen)
- **THEN** this is a parity regression, not a cosmetic deferral
- **AND** the game is not eligible for parity registration until it
  repaints and animates to parity with the C build
