## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The engine supports an ephemeral Hint System

The engine SHALL support a UI-only, ephemeral Hint System built on **plans**.
The `Game` interface SHALL define an optional `hint(state, aux?)` method returning
a non-empty ordered plan of `HintStep`s — each a move plus a human-readable
explanation and optional visual highlights, narrated for the state that step
applies to (`HintResult`). The optional second argument `aux` is the generator's
solution hint (upstream `aux_info`), the same value passed to `solve`; the
`Midend` SHALL pass its stored `aux` so a game whose best hint derives from the
known solution can use it when present (and fall back otherwise), while deductive
games ignore it. The `Midend` SHALL store the whole plan plus a current-step index
in `activeHint` (midend-only, never in game state, never persisted), SHALL display
**at most** one step at a time (the displayed step is passed to the game's `redraw`
and its explanation appended to the status bar; a stored plan MAY be hidden,
displaying nothing), and SHALL recompute a plan only when no valid plan is stored.

Plan lifecycle:
- `midend.hint()` SHALL re-display the stored plan's current step (no
  recompute, no advance) while a plan is active, and SHALL compute and store
  a fresh plan at index 0 otherwise.
- `midend.executeHint()` SHALL execute the current step of the stored plan
  (computing a plan first if none is stored), keep that step displayed through
  the move's animation, and advance to the next step — displayed, as the
  auto-play preview — when the animation settles.
- A player move while a plan is active SHALL be classified by the game's
  `hintKeepTrack(move, currentStep, state)` verdict, whether or not the plan
  is currently displayed: `"completed"` advances the plan to the next step
  and **hides the display** (the user asks again to see the next step — one
  hint per request in manual play) — unless the next step is flagged
  `continuesPrevious` (the continuation of a journey the completed step
  previewed, e.g. the "then to column 5" leg), in which case the display
  SHALL stay on and transition to that step: a journey is presented as one
  hint and stays on screen through its legs. `"onTrack"` keeps the current
  step displayed (the game MAY adjust the step's move in place to reflect
  partial progress), and `"off"` drops the plan. A game returning
  `"completed"` is asserting that the resulting state matches the plan's
  expectation, so the remaining steps stay valid.
- The plan SHALL be cleared on undo, redo, restart, new game, solve, when the
  last step completes, and when the board reaches the solved state.

**Hint-authoring convention — one deduction firing = one journey.** When a
game's `hint()` derives its plan from a solver/deduction engine, a **single
logical deduction that forces more than one move** (e.g. a coupled pair of
edges, or a clue that simultaneously resolves several of its sides) SHALL be
emitted as **one journey**: an ordered run of `HintStep`s whose first leg
carries the full explanation of the deduction (and SHOULD surface the whole set
visually, e.g. the other forced moves as sibling highlights) and whose
subsequent legs are flagged `continuesPrevious` with abbreviated narration.
Distinct deductions remain separate hints (the first leg of each is
unflagged, so the user asks again to see the next deduction). This keeps the
manual flow ("clear this one, then the rest" stays on screen through its legs)
and the auto-play flow (the legs animate back-to-back as one multi-part move)
consistent across every game whose hints group naturally.

**Hint-authoring convention — element-type colour legend.** When a game's hint
narration names **more than one distinct kind of board element** (e.g. a filled
cell as premise versus the forced cell as conclusion, or a clue versus a
region), the game's `redraw` SHALL distinguish those types with a **stable
per-game colour legend**: each element type is assigned one highlight colour used
consistently across all that game's hints (so the legend is learnable), and only
the types a given hint actually names are highlighted. Each legend colour SHALL
be paired with a **non-colour cue** (ring versus shade versus fill, the drawn
digit/clue, or position) so the type mapping survives for colourblind players —
colour SHALL NOT be the sole carrier, and colour names SHALL NOT appear in the
narration text. This convention is orthogonal to "equivalent moves share a
colour": equivalent *forced moves* still share the single target colour; the
legend governs *premise/element types*.

A non-deductive game (no technique to teach) MAY instead derive its plan from
the known solution via `aux`: it is a legitimate hint strategy to walk the
player to the unique solution. Such a game SHOULD prefer the `aux`-derived plan
when `aux` is present (guaranteeing the plan completes) and MAY fall back to a
local heuristic when it is absent.

#### Scenario: A hint naming multiple element types colours them by a stable legend

- **WHEN** a game's displayed hint step narrates two distinct board-element
  types (for example a cited filled/decided premise cell and the forced target
  cell)
- **THEN** `redraw` highlights each type in its own legend colour, paired with a
  distinguishing non-colour cue, rather than rendering both in the single target
  colour

#### Scenario: A legend colour is the same across different hints of one game

- **WHEN** two different hints of the same game each name the same element type
  (for example "a shaded square" appears as a premise in two different
  deductions)
- **THEN** that element type is drawn in the same legend colour in both hints

#### Scenario: Requesting a hint from the midend

- **WHEN** the user requests a hint via `midend.hint()` with no active plan,
  on a game that implements the `hint` method
- **THEN** the midend computes a plan once, stores it with index 0, appends
  the first step's explanation to the status bar, and schedules a repaint
