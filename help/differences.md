# Differences in this version

This web adaptation of Simon Tatham’s Portable Puzzle Collection includes
some features and UI changes that are not included in the original.

::experimental|Experimental:: Items with this symbol are considered experimental.
Although functional, they're likely to change significantly in future updates.
(There's also a slight possibility they might be removed entirely.)

## Changes affecting all puzzles

* ::experimental|Experimental:: This version allows you to save and return 
  to arbitrary [checkpoints](features#checkpoints) within the undo history.

* The command line options described in the manual are not available on the web. 
  However, you can provide game parameters or an ID or random seed in the
  URL to particular puzzle: add *?type=params* or *?id=id-or-seed*. (From within 
  a game, look in the <command-link command="share:link">share dialog</command-link>
  for copyable links.) 

## Changes to specific puzzles

* **Light Up**: the difficulty the original calls *Hard* is named
  *Unreasonable* here. Those boards require trial and error by construction
  (the built-in hints can only walk you up to the point where guessing
  starts); *Easy* and *Tricky* are always solvable by pure deduction.

(Other changes to individual puzzles have been accepted back into the original 
collection.)
